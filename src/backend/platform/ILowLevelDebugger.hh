/*
This interface is designed to be implemented by a low-level debugger class.
It provides methods for attaching to a process, detaching from it, and stepping through its execution.
The interface is implementing the RAII pattern, which means that it will automatically manage the call to detach() when the last copy of the object is destroyed.
This includes detaching from the process when the object is destroyed.
